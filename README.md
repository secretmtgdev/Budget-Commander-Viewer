## Screenshot of the week

## Objective
Tired of looking at budget options on EDHrec that aren't quite budget? Look no further for now you'll soon be able to search for specific staples in your commanders color identity within your budget with the click of a button!

## What can be done now?
- Query by multiple color selections, single shard, and non-overlapping builds
- Query by price range
- View returned by queries

## What needs cleaning up
- Disabling logic for invalid shard and guild selections
- Style of the price range
- Caching responses to speed up load time
- More filters
- Prevent non-commander legal cards from being shown
